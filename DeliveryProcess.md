# Delivery process

## Principles

- We produce open source software created and maintained in repositories where it may be inspected by the public who places their trust in it and copied for use by other agencies
- We adhere to the basic practices of agile software development
- We foster an open, collaborative, welcoming environment
- We invite relevant decision-makers at the table during all meetings to maximize efficiency and maintain momentum
- We practice human-centered design
- Everything that we produce is highly accessible, per WCAG 2.0
- We seek to use DevSecOps to automate and measure our deployment process, relying on continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous security to ensure that our work is high-quality
- We will build APIs before we build software atop it, and we believe that APIs require a well-designed interface


## Frameworks

To set ourselves up for success for the quarter we are working on this engagement (and set up our partner for continued success once we leave), we apply a subset of [the Scaled Agile Framework](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/) (SAFe) to guide our work, as described in [Essential SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/what-is-safe#Essential). 

We set goals and prioritize work in three month periods called "program increments," or PIs, and practice a number of SAFe rituals around this quarterly cadence.

To manage our day-to-day work, we practice Scrumban, which means we practice [Kanban](http://blog.crisp.se/2009/06/26/henrikkniberg/1246053060000) around cardwall-style boards that track work from left-to-right as it is identified, prioritized, explored, delivered, and demonstrated. We augment Kanban with a subset of Scrum activities (or "rituals"), found below.


## Rituals

### Standup
- A quick (15-minute) video or asynchronous (Slack) daily standup to communicate about the status of the work we commit to each sprint

### Sprint review/demo
- Bi-weekly sprint demos for stakeholders and colleagues of our recent work to share and get feedback

### Retrospectives
- Bi-weekly retrospectives so we can celebrate and build on successes, identify and mitigate failure, and get better with each cycle

### Sprint planning and grooming
- Regular higher-level planning and grooming sessions

## Kanban process

Kanban basically says cards go through a set of states (represented columns on a board), but it doesn't say much about what the cards represent or how the states are defined. Here's what they mean to us:

### Cards on boards

Cards on our boards typically capture and track a bug, raw task, or user story. Bugs and tasks are what they sound like. **Stories** represent tactical increments of individually-valuable work deliverable by a team within a single iteration.

**Features** or **Epics** are roadmap-worthy changes in product capabilities tracked against regular milestones. That is, larger items that are worth planning and announcing on a regular basis.

### WIP Limits

Work-in-progress (WIP) limits help us focus and are generally designated on a per-column basis. That means we expect to see no more than that number of cards in the column at a time. If you want to move a card right into a column that's already at its WIP limit, first figure out how to help move one of the existing cards out to the right, including pairing with a team member to help out (and share context). If the next column is also at its WIP limit, that's your cue to keep working your way over to the right, asking "how can I help?" when you encounter something being worked on for which there's space to move.

In general we use WIP limits to gate how much time and effort we put into grooming cards when we haven't got capacity to do them yet, and to gate how many things we're trying to do at once so that we focus on finishing existing work before starting new work. We don't want individuals to be responsible for more than one or two cards in progress at a time, and we generally like team members to collaborate and pair up to get work done, so our WIP limit for cards actually getting development attention is set intentionally slightly low to encourage this.


## Special roles

### Product owner

To support this approach, it is essential that we have the support of a dedicated and empowered product owner within FRTIB who is responsible for representing the project and its deliverables internally while providing consistent access to relevant users and stakeholders. The product owner should also serve as the “champion for the engagement” by offering strategic advice and ensuring the active participation of key stakeholders for the duration of the engagement. 

We look to the product owner to prioritize research, design, and code deliverables and help shape the overall vision for our work. The product owner should also set the vision for various levels of work, including the product, engagement, and sprint while regularly reminding the team of these so they always know what work they are doing and why it is important.

There is more information about the product owner role in the [18F Partnership Playbook](https://18f.gsa.gov/partnership-principles/#partnering-with-an-empowered-product-owner).
