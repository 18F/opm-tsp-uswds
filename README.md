## Prototype

### About the prototype

* This prototype uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby-based static site generator. For more information about using Jekyll, refer to the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

* The site is built with the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov), a set of reusable, high-quality components for modern websites. We're using the Web Design Standards [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll) with some customized styles.

### Running prototype locally

After cloning the repo, navigate to the correct folder and install Jekyll and any necessary dependencies using:
```
cd tsp-uswds/sandbox
```

```
npm install
```

```
bundle install
```

To run the site locally, from the `sandbox` folder, run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

If all goes well, visit the site at `http://localhost:4000`.
