# Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board - Thrift Savings Plan (TSP.gov)

## Welcome!
This repository contains documentation describing the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) tsp.gov engagement. It is intended to be a place where project team members, stakeholders, and other interested parties can keep track of goals and resouces as we work together. 

## History

FRTIB, the agency that administers the Thrift Savings Plan to help government employees save for retirement, has engaged 18F to help FRTIB’s in-house design team in the Office of Communications and Education (OCE) develop capabilities in agile software development, user-centered design, and content strategy. This work will set direction and build practices to continue redesigning tsp.gov in an agile and user-centered way. 

## Users and stakeholders

FRTIB serves over five million participants (current or former federal employees or members of the military) as well as their beneficiaries. In 2018, the agency is enrolling and transitioning thousands of military service members into the TSP’s new “blended retirement” system, resulting in hundreds of thousands of estimated new users each year. 

FRTIB also coordinates with over 100 payroll offices in the federal government that oversee those employees. In addition to serving users through tsp.gov, FRTIB manages a large volume of phone calls (2.8-3 million in 2017) in its call centers, a number which is likely to increase as users will start retiring in larger amounts. 

## Problem being solved

In collaboration with federal agencies, we want to help federal employees, uniformed service members, and their beneficiaries develop an understanding of their retirement options in order to be engaged in investing through the TSP.

## Anticipated outcomes

Key outcomes we currently anticipate for this work are:
 - Define users of tsp.gov, including their needs, motivations, and preferences when accessing the site 
 - Develop a vision and roadmap for tsp.gov that outlines design priorities for the site based on user needs, the mission of FRTIB, and stakeholder goals. The roadmap will leverage the U.S. Web Design Standards and other best practices, including agile product development, to recommend specific opportunities for improving the user experience and content for the site
Provide coaching throughout the engagement that helps FRTIB work in a more agile, open, and human centered way. Examples of this may include developing a repeatable process for testing new design iterations and strategies for prioritizing the product backlog
 - Provide a foundation so FRTIB can relaunch tsp.gov to successful outcomes in 2018

At the end of our work together, the in-house team at FRTIB will have developed additional skills and capabilities needed to successfully implement against a prioritized roadmap. 

Any features and recommendations should be developed and implemented by the in-house FRTIB team as they are best positioned to implement and iterate on the roadmap that we will collaboratively develop together. 

## Metrics for success

These are the metrics we are following to determine the degree to which this engagement has been successful:
 - Whether or not the team, as a whole, is developing and testing hypotheses with users by using prototypes
 - Whether or not FRTIB team members are planning and leading research sessions
 - Whether or not FRTIB team members are leading standups, sprint planning, sprint review, and retrospectives
 - Whether or not we have created a roadmap, content recommendations, and research findings to deliver at the end of the engagement

## Roadmap

The work we plan to take on are sequenced in our project [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/QvYdQMaY/18f-tsp-uswds), and we are developing with FRTIB a recommended roadmap for the next few quarters as part of the deliverables for this engagement so the design team has a clear path toward desired outcomes once this engagement ends.

## Risks and mitigations

Risk: We are not aligned on the key work to be done.
Mitigation: We conducted a kickoff meeting to discuss scope and areas of opportunity, making sure we are aligned on what work we may and may not take on as part of this engagement. We also conduct sprint planning jointly with FRTIB team members empowered to make decisions about this project and are conducting “50%” and “75%” meetings to check in on progress and any changes in priorities over the course of the engagement.

Risk: FRITB is unable to continue this work once 18F rolls off the engagement.
Mitigation: FRTIB and 18F team members work alongside each other every day and conduct activities, including daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, retrospectives, and execution of the work together. Before the end of the engagement, we intend for FRTIB team members to lead all regular rituals and also have experienece leading activities such as hypotheses development, and user research, and vision-setting.

Risk: Technical and workflow obstacles, including Github being blocked on the FRTIB network and lack of access to a shared documents tool, hamper our work.
Mitigation: With 18F security leads, meet with IT staff to learn about their context and concerns about use of these tools so they can be unblocked. Simultaneously, focus on value where it can be delivered today using current tools.

## Prototype

### About the prototype

* This prototype uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby-based static site generator. For more information about using Jekyll, refer to the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

* The site is built with the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov), a set of reusable, high-quality components for modern websites. We're using the Web Design Standards [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll) with some customized styles.

### Running prototype locally

After cloning the repo, navigate to the correct folder and install Jekyll and any necessary dependencies using:
```
cd tsp-uswds/sandbox
```

```
npm install
```

```
bundle install
```

To run the site locally, from the `sandbox` folder, run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

If all goes well, visit the site at `http://localhost:4000`.
